Project 2 is about analyzing shallow water waves and their resonant frequencies. We also studied their phase velocities, theoretical vs measured to understand how the real world works in relation to our models. We had to use Fourier transforms.

Project 3 is about sonoluminescence. Essentially, we created a small bubble inside of a container of water, which we were sending oscillations through. This caused the bubble to become trapped in the center, while also rapidly becoming larger and smaller. Though there are a couple theories about why this is, I personally think it was due to the bubble's contents' rapid expansion, causing some sort of plasma-like substance to form for a fraction of a second. This was barely visible to the naked eye, but still visible. To gather more accurate data, we shined a laser on the bubble and measured how much light was reflected off the bubble. (Larger bubble, more light; smaller bubble, less light) Though this project contains no code, it was by far the most interesting lab I've ever done.

Project 4 is about superfluid helium at very low temperatures, think 1-2 Kelvin. We measured the properties of this substance such as the speed of sound, porosity, and the specific heat. This lab was extremely interesting as I had never interacted with something that was such a low temperature, and its properties were not at all what I expected.
